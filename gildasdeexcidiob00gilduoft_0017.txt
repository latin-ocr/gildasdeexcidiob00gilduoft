Gildas Albanius, who must be carefully dis-
tinguished from the author of the work now
printed, is he whose exploits form the sub-
ject os the ‘Vita Gildae’ prefixed to the prc-
sent volume. We shall, in the first place,
offer a few remarks upon this earlier individual.
He was born about A.n. 42:332 and in the thir-
teenth year of his age passed over from Scot—
land, of which he was a native, into France, at
that time under the rule of Childeric, the son os
Merovius,3 where he founded the monastery ol'
Ruys.⁴ The Legend printed by Mabillon, aster
detailing his various miracles, and ascribing to
him the authorship of the ‘ Epistolaris Libellus‚’
proceeds to recount his death, which, according
to it, occurred in France; and contains inter-
nal evidence of having been composed, or at
least reduced to its present form, in the eleveuth

century.⁵
