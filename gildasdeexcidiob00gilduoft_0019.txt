PREFACE. ix

have indeed received from Beda a different inter-
pretation from that which we have here assign-
ed to them. That writer understands them as
meaning that the siege of Kair Badon occurred
sorty-four years aster the arrival of the Saxons in
England,¹ whereas they seem rather to show that
Gildas wrote his Epistle sorty-four years aster
that siege, he being then in the sorty-fourth year
of his age.² Admitting that Beda has here, as
elsewhere,³ been misled by the turgid and in-
volved style of the author, it remains for us to fix
the date of the siege of Kair Badon, which, as has
been already stated, was coeval with the birth of
Gildas. The argument in favour of the year
520 rests partly upon the direct authority of Mat-
thew of W⁷est1ninster‚⁴ and partly upon the data
furnished by an anonymous British chronicler,⁵
who affirms that twenty-two years elapsed be—

hostes, vincebant, . . . usque ad tis! His argument to cap. xviii.
annum obsessionis Badonici mon·¹ shows that he understood it as
