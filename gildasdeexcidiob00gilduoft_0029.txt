been undertaken by John J osseline, secretary to
Archbishop Parker‚ an edition of that Historian
was published in the year 1568? In the Intro—
duction, which he has prefixed to his work, the
editor informs us that he had made use of two
manuscripts; one of them above six hundred
years old, formerly belonging to St. Augus-

tleman. It is probable that neither os these
manuscripts came into the possession os Arch-
bishop Parker‚ whose zeal for the collection of
such remains of antiquity is well known.
