of that writer, but not mentioning him by name.¹

It may hence bc concluded that Geoffrey of Mon-
mouth had seen a copy of the ‘ Historia Brit-
tonum‚' to which the name of Nennius was not
prefixed, and that he fell into the common error

of ascribing to Gildas the anonymous work which
afterwards was generally ascribed to Nennius.
Giraldus CambrensiS, too, cites Gildas‚ but in a ⁷
manner too vague to be conclusive in the pre-
sent inquiry ;2 although there seems reason, from
other passageS‚ to conclude that he was acquainted

· with the ‘ Epistola Gildae 3’ believing‚ however,
that its author was the contemporary of Arthur.³
