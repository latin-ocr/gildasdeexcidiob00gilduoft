tween that siege and the death ofArthur at the
battle of Camelon, which latter event Usher as—
signs to the year 542) Deducting, therefore,
twenty-two years from A.D. 542, we fall back
upon the year 520, as the year of the birth os
Gildas.

ξ 6. Such a system of chronology, moreover, is
perfectly reconcileable with the internal evidence
furnished by the writer. Although this informa-
tion is scanty, it is sufficiently definite at once to
refute the opposite theory, and to establish the
general accuracy of the view which has now been
taken of the subject. The present work contains
exhortations to various eminent personages ;2 and
it can be shown that no such individuals were con-
temporaries, except about the period which we
assign to Gildas Badonicus, an argument too
strong not to determine the controversy in favour
of the doctrine of Usher.

ἕ 7. Having thus shown that Gildas Badonicus

was written. .

is to be distinguished from Gildas Albanius, and
that he was born about A. D. 520, it is not difficult
to ascertain the exact time at which the following
work was composed, Gildas having stated that he
wrote it in the forty-sourth year os his age. We
cannot hesitate, therefore, in concluding that the
‘ Epistola Gildae’ was composed in the year 564.3
