PREFACE.

ἓ l. THERE are few writers of English History theoton-<m
whose biography has led to so much discussion glssgcoss'rffizm
as St. Gildas. We are unable to speak with cer-
tainty as to his parentage, his country, or even
his name‚¹ the period when he lived, or the
works of which he was the author. It is con-
tended by some that only one individual bear-
ing this name attained any eminence during the
Middle Ages, and that to him relate all the Le-
gends in which St.Gildas is commemorated3 while
others assert, with equal pertinacity‚ that there
were at least two personages of the name, and
that the exploits of the one have, in some de-
gree, been ascribed to the other. Without en-
tering into this controversy, we shall endeavour
to profit by the information which it has elicited,
adopting those results which, upon an examina-
tion of the rival theorieS‚ bear the greatest ap-

pearance of probability.

¹See the following section, MSS„ see the present volume,
and the reference to Beda there 35, 18. The passage, however,
given. He is, apparently, sur· may be understood as if Cor-mac
named ‘ Cormac' by the copyist were the name os the scribe‚not an
of the earliest of the existiug adJuncttuthenanu·osum author.
